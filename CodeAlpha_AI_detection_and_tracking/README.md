# 👁️ Task 3: Vision Engine – AI Object Detection & Tracking

## 📝 Description

The **Vision Engine** is a high-speed computer vision system designed for real-time situational awareness. Built on the cutting-edge **YOLOv11** architecture, it doesn't just "see" objects—it tracks them. By implementing the **ByteTrack** algorithm, the system assigns unique, persistent IDs to every detected object, allowing for sophisticated monitoring across live video streams.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Next-Gen Detection:** Powered by **YOLOv11** for state-of-the-art accuracy and millisecond inference speeds.
* **Persistent Identity:** Advanced tracking that remembers objects (e.g., "Car ID: 5") even through movement and occlusion.
* **High-Tech HUD:** A custom-designed dashboard featuring a live scan panel and real-time FPS counter.
* **Futuristic Visuals:** Professional "Scanner-style" corner brackets and translucent overlays for a premium aesthetic.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

* **Architecture:** YOLOv11 (Ultralytics)
* **Tracking:** ByteTrack Engine
* **Visuals:** OpenCV (High-Performance Rendering)
* **Logic:** Python 3.x & NumPy

## ⚙️ Execution Instructions

1. **Install Requirements:**
pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy

2. **Run Application:**
python Tracker.py
